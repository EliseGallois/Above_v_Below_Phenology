## Abstract

The below-ground growing season often extends beyond the above-ground growing season in tundra ecosystems. However, we do not yet know where and when this occurs and whether these phenological asynchronies are driven by variation in local vegetation communities or by spatial variation in microclimate. Here, we combined above- and below-ground plant phenology metrics to compare the relative timings and magnitudes of leaf and root growth and senescence across microclimates and plant communities at five sites across the tundra biome. We observed asynchronous growth between above-ground and below-ground plant tissue, with the below-ground season extending up to 74% beyond the onset of above-ground leaf senescence. Plant community type, rather than microclimate, was a key factor controlling the timing, productivity and growth rates of roots, with graminoid roots exhibiting a distinct ‘pulse’ of growth later into the growing season than shrub roots. Our findings indicate the potential of vegetation change to influence below-ground carbon storage as roots remain active in unfrozen soils for longer as the climate warms. Taken together, increased root growth in soils that remain thawed later into the growing season, in combination with ongoing tundra vegetation change including increased shrubs and graminoids, can act together to alter below-ground productivity and carbon cycling in the tundra biome.
